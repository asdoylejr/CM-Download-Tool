This is a simple script that checks CyanogenMod's download page for updated downloads.

This sits on my file server and downloads automatically downloads for me.

It will download any new versions regardless of state (nightly, RC, stable, etc.)

I realize now that the filename is stupid.  It's not CyanogenMod-Mod.  I'm an idiot, sorry.
